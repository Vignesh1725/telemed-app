Great question! You want to **send multiple user IDs selected from a dashboard to the VideoRoom component and pass them to the socket client** so you can restrict the room access or trigger calls only among those users.

Let me break down how you can do this smoothly.

---

## 1. Flow overview

* **Dashboard**: User selects multiple users (user IDs).
* **Navigate to VideoRoom**: Pass the list of user IDs and the room ID to VideoRoom.
* **VideoRoom**: Receive the list, initialize socket with those user IDs.
* **Socket connection**: Use the allowed user IDs to control who can join / call.

---

## 2. Passing user IDs from Dashboard to VideoRoom

### Option A: Pass user IDs via URL query params or React Router state

Suppose your URL is `/room/:roomId`.

* You can pass additional data via `React Router` **location state** or **query parameters**.

**Example using React Router state:**

```jsx
// Dashboard.js
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

const Dashboard = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const selectedUserIds = ["user1", "user2", "user3"]; // selected from UI
  const roomId = "room1";

  const handleJoinRoom = () => {
    navigate(`/room/${roomId}`, { state: { allowedUserIds: selectedUserIds } });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleJoinRoom}>Join Room</button>;
};

export default Dashboard;
```

---

### In VideoRoom.js

```js
import { useLocation, useParams } from "react-router-dom";

const VideoRoom = () => {
  const { roomId } = useParams();
  const location = useLocation();
  const allowedUserIds = location.state?.allowedUserIds || [];

  // Now you have allowedUserIds from the dashboard here!
  console.log("Allowed users for this room:", allowedUserIds);

  // You can send these IDs along with your socket events
  // Example:
  useEffect(() => {
    socketRef.current = io("http://localhost:5000");

    // Example: send your own userId and allowedUserIds on join-room event
    const currentUserId = "user1"; // Get this from your auth or context
    socketRef.current.emit("join-room", {
      roomId,
      userId: currentUserId,
      allowedUserIds
    });

    // ... rest of your effect logic
  }, [roomId, allowedUserIds]);
}
```

## 3. Using allowedUserIds on server side to restrict join

As I mentioned before, your server can now use that array to validate:

```js
socket.on("join-room", ({ roomId, userId, allowedUserIds }) => {
  if (!allowedUserIds.includes(userId)) {
    socket.emit("unauthorized");
    socket.disconnect();
    return;
  }
  socket.join(roomId);
});
```

But usually the allowed users list should be stored **server-side** or fetched from a database. Passing it from client can be tampered with, so a better practice is:

* Pass only your userId and roomId to server
* Server checks allowed users list internally for the room

---

## 4. Summary

* From Dashboard: send the array of userIds to VideoRoom via router state or query param.
* In VideoRoom: read that list, use it in socket connection.
* On Server: check if connecting userId is allowed for the room (compare with allowed list).
* You can use `socket.emit` and `socket.on` to send data back and forth.

If you want, I can help you with a complete minimal example for Dashboard -> VideoRoom -> Socket communication with allowed users. Just say!
